         * The following needs to be synchronized/locked even with a synchronized/thread-safe data structure such as LinkedBlockingDeque because
         * the logic involves multiple steps to check existence, create an object then insert the object. The 'check' or 'insertion' themselves
         * are thread-safe by themselves but not the aggregate algorithm, thus we put this entire block of logic inside synchronized.
         *
         * I am using a tryLock if/then (http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html#tryLock())
         * so that a single thread will get the lock and as soon as one thread gets the lock all others will go the 'else' block
         * and just return the currentBucket until the newBucket is created. This should allow the throughput to be far higher
         * and only slow down 1 thread instead of blocking all of them in each cycle of creating a new bucket based on some testing
         * (and it makes sense that it should as well).
         *
         * This means the timing won't be exact to the millisecond as to what data ends up in a bucket, but that's acceptable.
         * It's not critical to have exact precision to the millisecond, as long as it's rolling, if we can instead reduce the impact synchronization.
         *
         * More importantly though it means that the 'if' block within the lock needs to be careful about what it changes that can still
         * be accessed concurrently in the 'else' block since we're not completely synchronizing access.
         *
         * For example, we can't have a multi-step process to add a bucket, remove a bucket, then update the sum since the 'else' block of code
         * can retrieve the sum while this is all happening. The trade-off is that we don't maintain the rolling sum and let readers just iterate
         * bucket to calculate the sum themselves. This is an example of favoring write-performance instead of read-performance and how the tryLock
         * versus a synchronized block needs to be accommodated.
